### Getting Started with GraphQL, Apollo, and React

August 17th, 2017 @ [Midwest JS](http://midwestjs.com) <br />
with Ryan Glover (CEO, [Clever Beagle](http://cleverbeagle.com))

In this talk, we'll take a hands-on look at using React and GraphQL together, utilizing Apollo as the glue between the client and our data source (MongoDB). We'll learn how to wire up a simple GraphQL server and schema, piping data from the server to the client using Apollo's `apollo-client` NPM package. We'll also discuss some high-level theory on why we'd want to use GraphQL in our apps and how it can help us to better manage data in our user interfaces.
